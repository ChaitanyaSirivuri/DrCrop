## Modules

### 1. Crop Recommendation

The Crop Recommendation module leverages machine learning algorithms to provide farmers with personalized crop recommendations based on various factors such as soil type, climate, and historical crop performance data. It helps farmers make optimal choices when selecting the crops to cultivate, taking into account their specific conditions.

### 2. Fertilizer Recommendation

The Fertilizer Recommendation module uses data-driven approaches to suggest the appropriate types and quantities of fertilizers for a given crop and soil condition. By analyzing soil nutrient levels and crop nutrient requirements, it helps farmers maximize crop yields while minimizing fertilizer costs and environmental impact.

### 3. Image Disease Prediction

The Image Disease Prediction module employs deep learning techniques to diagnose crop diseases from images captured by farmers. It can identify common crop diseases and provide timely recommendations for disease management. This enables farmers to take proactive measures to protect their crops from diseases, ultimately increasing crop productivity.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for easy access and interaction.
- Data-driven recommendations for crop selection and fertilizer application.
- Deep learning-powered image analysis for disease detection.
- Personalized advice based on location-specific data.
- Historical data tracking and reporting for improved decision-making.
